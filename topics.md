* Introduction to Idris
  * explain and show examples for "type, define, refine"
  * with precise types, the compiler can help you with the implementation (proof search)
* How to use types effectively to make programming easier
  * Why you shouldn't use `Int`, `String`, or `Boolean`
  * More precise types help you with the implementation
* "make illegal states unrepresentable"
